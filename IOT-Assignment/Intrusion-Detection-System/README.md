# Intrusion Detection System

An **intrusion detection system (IDS)** is designed to detect unauthorized access or suspicious activities within a protected area. It uses sensors, such as PIR motion detectors, to monitor movement and triggers alerts like alarms or notifications when unexpected activity is detected. IDS solutions are widely employed in security systems to safeguard homes, businesses, and restricted areas by promptly identifying potential threats.
