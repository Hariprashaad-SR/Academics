# **Air Monitoring System**

An **air monitoring system** measures and tracks environmental parameters like **air quality, temperature, and humidity** to ensure healthy indoor or outdoor conditions. This system uses sensors like **MQ-135 (Air Quality Sensor)**, **DHT11/DHT22 (Temperature & Humidity Sensor)**, and outputs real-time data. It can trigger alerts if pollutants exceed acceptable levels and display the values on an **LCD screen** or send notifications for timely action.
