A **fitness monitoring system** tracks key health metrics such as **heart rate, body temperature, and movement** to help users maintain their fitness goals. The system uses sensors like a **pulse sensor** and **temperature sensor (LM35)** to collect real-time data, which is displayed on an **LCD screen** or sent to a smartphone. It can also provide alerts when the heart rate exceeds a certain threshold, ensuring safety during exercise.
