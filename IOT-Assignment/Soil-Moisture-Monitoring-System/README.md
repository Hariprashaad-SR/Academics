# **Soil Moisture Monitoring System**

A **soil moisture monitoring system** ensures optimal water levels for plants by detecting soil dryness using a **soil moisture sensor**. This system helps automate irrigation by triggering water pumps or alarms when moisture drops below a specified threshold. It can also provide real-time updates on moisture levels to prevent overwatering and conserve water.
