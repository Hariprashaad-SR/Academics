This assignment focuses on simulating **IoT-based systems** using suitable processors, sensors, and actuators to monitor and automate real-world scenarios. Below is a short recap of the five required IoT systems.  

---

### **1. Air Quality Monitoring System (Indoor/Outdoor)**  
- **Purpose:** Monitors air quality by measuring levels of pollutants (e.g., CO2, PM2.5) along with temperature and humidity.  
- **Sensors/Actuators Used:**  
  - MQ-135 (Air Quality Sensor)  
  - DHT11/DHT22 (Temperature & Humidity Sensor)  
  - LCD Display (for data visualization)  
  - Buzzer or LED (alerts for poor air quality)  
- **Application:** Ensures healthy air quality in homes, offices, or public areas by alerting users when pollutant levels exceed acceptable limits.

### **2. Fitness Monitoring System (At least 5 Vital Signs)**  
- **Purpose:** Tracks key health metrics to help users maintain their fitness and ensure safety during exercise.  
- **Sensors/Actuators Used:**  
  - Pulse Sensor (Heart Rate Monitoring)  
  - LM35 (Body Temperature Sensor)  
  - Accelerometer (Movement Detection)  
  - SPO2 Sensor (Blood Oxygen Level)  
  - ECG Module (Cardiac Activity)  
  - Buzzer (alerts for abnormal metrics)  
- **Application:** Provides real-time feedback to ensure safe physical activity, preventing over-exertion through alerts.

### **3. SMART Irrigation System**  
- **Purpose:** Automates watering based on real-time soil moisture and environmental conditions, conserving water while ensuring healthy plant growth.  
- **Sensors/Actuators Used:**  
  - Soil Moisture Sensor (to detect dryness)  
  - DHT11/DHT22 (Temperature & Humidity Sensor)  
  - Water Pump (actuator for irrigation)  
  - Rain Sensor (optional, for outdoor use)  
- **Application:** Controls irrigation by activating the pump only when needed, ensuring optimal soil moisture levels for crops or gardens.

### **4. Intrusion Detection System**  
- **Purpose:** Detects unauthorized access or suspicious activities and triggers alerts to protect homes or restricted areas.  
- **Sensors/Actuators Used:**  
  - PIR Motion Sensor (for movement detection)  
  - Ultrasonic Sensor (to detect proximity)  
  - Buzzer/Alarm (for alerts)  
  - Camera Module (optional, for capturing evidence)  
- **Application:** Ensures security by sending alerts or activating alarms upon detecting unauthorized movements.

### **5. Home Automation System (At least 3 Appliances)**  
- **Purpose:** Automates control of home appliances to improve convenience, energy efficiency, and security.  
- **Sensors/Actuators Used:**  
  - Light Sensor (for smart lighting control)  
  - Temperature Sensor (for climate control)  
  - Relays or Switch Modules (to control appliances like fans, lights, and AC)  
  - Voice Module (optional, for voice commands)  
- **Application:** Controls appliances remotely or automatically based on environmental conditions, enabling smart home management.
